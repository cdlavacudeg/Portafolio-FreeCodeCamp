/*Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords
If you are unfamiliar with let, check out this challenge.

When you declare a variable with the var keyword, it is declared globally, 
or locally if declared inside a function.

The let keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. 
When you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, 
its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.

For example:*/

var numArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
console.log(i);
/*
Here the console will display the values [0, 1, 2] and 3.

With the var keyword, i is declared globally. So when i++ is executed, 
it updates the global variable. This code is similar to the following:*/

var numArray = [];
var i;
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
console.log(i);
/*
Here the console will display the values [0, 1, 2] and 3.

This behavior will cause problems if you were to create a function 
and store it for later use inside a for loop that uses the i variable. 
This is because the stored function will always refer to the value 
of the updated global i variable.*/

var printNumTwo;
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());

/*
Here the console will display the value 3.

As you can see, printNumTwo() prints 3 and not 2. 
This is because the value assigned to i was updated 
and the printNumTwo() returns the global i and not the value i 
had when the function was created in the for loop. 
The let keyword does not follow this behavior:*/

let printNumTwo;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
console.log(i);

/*Here the console will display the value 2, and an error that i is not defined.

i is not defined because it was not declared in the global scope.
 It is only declared within the for loop statement. 
 printNumTwo() returned the correct value because 
 three different i variables with unique values (0, 1, and 2)
  were created by the let keyword within the loop statement.*/

  function checkScope() {
    let i = 'function scope';
    if (true) {
      let i = 'block scope';
      console.log('Block scope i is: ', i);
    }
    console.log('Function scope i is: ', i);
    return i;
  }

  /*Prevent Object Mutation
As seen in the previous challenge, const declaration alone doesn't really protect 
your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, 
JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected, 
with an error thrown if the script is running in strict mode.*/

let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj); 
/*The obj.review and obj.newProp assignments will result in errors, 
because our editor runs in strict mode by default, and the console 
will display the value { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review: "Awesome" }.*/

/*Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions
In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, 
especially when passing a function as an argument to another function. 
Instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to name these functions 
because we do not reuse them anywhere else.

To achieve this, we often use the following syntax:*/

const myFunc = function() {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
/*ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar to not have to write anonymous 
functions this way. Instead, you can use arrow function syntax:*/

const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
/*When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function 
syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code. 
This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:*/

const myFunc = () => "value";
const magic = ()=> new Date();
const magic = ()=> {
    return new Date();
  };
/*This code will still return the string value by default.*/

/*Write Arrow Functions with Parameters
Just like a regular function, you can pass arguments into an arrow function.*/

const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
doubler(4);
/*doubler(4) would return the value 8.*/

/*If an arrow function has a single parameter, the parentheses enclosing 
the parameter may be omitted.*/

const doubler = item => item * 2;
/*It is possible to pass more than one argument into an arrow function.*/

const multiplier = (item, multi) => item * multi;
multiplier(4, 2);
/*multiplier(4, 2) would return the value 8.*/
const myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2);

console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));

/*Set Default Parameters for Your Functions
In order to help us create more flexible functions, 
ES6 introduces default parameters for functions.

Check out this code:*/

const greeting = (name = "Anonymous") => "Hello " + name;

console.log(greeting("John"));
console.log(greeting());
/*The console will display the strings Hello John and Hello Anonymous.
The default parameter kicks in when the argument is not specified (it is undefined). 
As you can see in the example above, the parameter name will receive its default 
value Anonymous when you do not provide a value for the parameter. 
You can add default values for as many parameters as you want.*/

/*Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters
In order to help us create more flexible functions, 
ES6 introduces the rest parameter for function parameters. 
With the rest parameter, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments.
 These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.

Check out this code:*/

function howMany(...args) {
  return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2));
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { }));
/*The console would display the strings You have passed 3 arguments. 
and You have passed 4 arguments..
The rest parameter eliminates the need to check the args array and allows us to apply map(), 
filter() and reduce() on the parameters array.*/
const sum = (x,y,z) => {
    const args = [x, y, z];
    return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  }

  const sum = (...args) => {
    return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  }

/*Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place
ES6 introduces the spread operator, 
which allows us to expand arrays and other expressions 
in places where multiple parameters or elements are expected.

The ES5 code below uses apply() to compute the maximum value in an array:*/

var arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
var maximus = Math.max.apply(null, arr);
/*maximus would have a value of 89.

We had to use Math.max.apply(null, arr) because Math.max(arr) returns NaN. 
Math.max() expects comma-separated arguments, but not an array. 
The spread operator makes this syntax much better to read and maintain.*/

const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
const maximus = Math.max(...arr);

/*maximus would have a value of 89.

...arr returns an unpacked array. In other words, it spreads the array. 
However, the spread operator only works in-place, like in an argument 
to a function or in an array literal. The following code will not work:*/

//const spreaded = ...arr;

//Copy all contents of arr1 into another array arr2 using the spread operator.

const arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
let arr2;

arr2 = [...arr1];  // Change this line

console.log(arr2);

/*Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects
Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, 
for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.

Consider the following ES5 code:*/

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;

/*name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

Here's an equivalent assignment statement using the ES6 destructuring syntax:*/

const { name, age } = user;

/*Again, name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.
Here, the name and age variables will be created and assigned the values of their 
respective values from the user object. You can see how much cleaner this is.

You can extract as many or few values from the object as you want.*/

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

const {today,tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;

/*Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects
Destructuring allows you to assign a new variable name when extracting values. 
You can do this by putting the new name after a colon when assigning the value.

Using the same object from the last example:*/

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
//Here's how you can give new variable names in the assignment:

const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
/*You may read it as "get the value of user.name and assign 
it to a new variable named userName" and so on. 
The value of userName would be the string John Doe, 
and the value of userAge would be the number 34.*/

const {today:highToday,tomorrow:highTomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;

/*Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects
You can use the same principles from the previous two lessons to destructure 
values from nested objects.

Using an object similar to previous examples:*/

const user = {
  johnDoe: { 
    age: 34,
    email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
  }
};
/*Here's how to extract the values of object properties and assign them to variables 
with the same name:*/

const { johnDoe: { age, email }} = user;
/*nd here's how you can assign an object properties' Â´
values to variables with different names:*/

const { johnDoe: { age: userAge, email: userEmail }} = user;

const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
  yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
  today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
  tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
};

const {today:{low:lowToday,high:highToday}}=LOCAL_FORECAST;

/*Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays
ES6 makes destructuring arrays as easy as destructuring objects.

One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring 
is that the spread operator unpacks all contents of an array into a comma-separated list.
Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elements you want to assign to variables.

Destructuring an array lets us do exactly that:*/

const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b);
/*The console will display the values of a and b as 1, 2.

The variable a is assigned the first value of the array, 
and b is assigned the second value of the array. 
We can also access the value at any index in an array 
with destructuring by using commas to reach the desired index:*/

const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b, c);

/*The console will display the values of a, b, and c as 1, 2, 5.*/

/*Use destructuring assignment to swap the values of a and b so that a receives the value stored in b, 
and b receives the value stored in a.*/

let a = 8, b = 6;
[a,b] =[b,a];

/*Use Destructuring Assignment with the Rest Parameter to Reassign Array Elements
In some situations involving array destructuring, we might want to collect the 
rest of the elements into a separate array.

The result is similar to Array.prototype.slice(), as shown below:*/

const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
console.log(a, b);
console.log(arr);
/*The console would display the values 1, 2 and [3, 4, 5, 7].

Variables a and b take the first and second values from the array. 
After that, because of the rest parameter's presence, arr gets 
the rest of the values in the form of an array. 
The rest element only works correctly as the last variable in the list. 
As in, you cannot use the rest parameter to catch a subarray that leaves 
out the last element of the original array.*/

/*Use destructuring assignment with the rest parameter to perform an effective Array.
prototype.slice() so that arr is a sub-array of the original array source with the first 
two elements omitted.*/
const source = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
function removeFirstTwo(list) {
  // Only change code below this line
  const [,,...arr] = list; // Change this line
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}
const arr = removeFirstTwo(source);

/*Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters
In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.

Consider the code below:*/

const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;

}
/*This effectively destructures the object sent into the function. This can also 
be done in-place:*/

const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {

}
/*When profileData is passed to the above function, the values are destructured 
from the function parameter for use within the function.*/

const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};

const half = ({max,min}) => (max + min) / 2.0; 
console.log(half(stats))

/*STRINGS*/
/*Create Strings using Template Literals
A new feature of ES6 is the template literal. 
This is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier.

Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string 
interpolation features to create strings.

Consider the code below:*/

const person = {
  name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
  age: 56
};

const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
I am ${person.age} years old.`;

console.log(greeting);
/*The console will display the strings Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro! and I am 56 years old..

A lot of things happened there. Firstly, the example uses backticks (`), not quotes (' or "), 
to wrap the string. Secondly, notice that the string is multi-line, both in the code and the 
output. This saves inserting \n within strings. The ${variable} syntax used above is a 
placeholder. Basically, you won't have to use concatenation with the + operator anymore. 
To add variables to strings, you just drop the variable in a template string and wrap 
it with ${ and }. Similarly, you can include other expressions in your string literal, 
for example ${a + b}. This new way of creating strings gives you more flexibility 
to create robust strings.*/

/*Write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand

  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    gender: gender

const createPerson = (name, age, gender) => ({name,age,gender});

/*Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6
When defining functions within objects in ES5, we have to use the keyword function as follows:*/

const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello: function() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;

/*Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function
ES6 provides a new syntax to create objects, using the class keyword.

It should be noted that the class syntax is just syntax, and not a 
full-fledged class-based implementation of an object-oriented paradigm, 
unlike in languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, etc.

In ES5, we usually define a constructor function and use the new keyword 
to instantiate an object.*/

var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){
  this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;

/*The class syntax simply replaces the constructor function creation:*/

  constructor(targetPlanet) {
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
}
const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
/*It should be noted that the class keyword declares a new function, 
to which a constructor is added. This constructor is invoked when new 
is called to create a new object.

Note: UpperCamelCase should be used by convention for ES6 class names, 
as in SpaceShuttle used above.*/

class Vegetable{
  constructor(name){
    this.name=name;
  }
 }
 const carrot = new Vegetable('carrot');
 console.log(carrot.name); // Should display 'carrot'

/*Use getters and setters to Control Access to an Object
You can obtain values from an object and set the value of a property within an object.

These are classically called getters and setters.

Getter functions are meant to simply return (get) the value of an object's private variable
 to the user without the user directly accessing the private variable.

Setter functions are meant to modify (set) the value of an object's private variable based 
on the value passed into the setter function. This change could involve calculations, 
or even overwriting the previous value completely.*/

class Book {
  constructor(author) {
    this._author = author;

    this._author = updatedAuthor;
  }
}
const novel = new Book('anonymous');
console.log(novel.writer);
novel.writer = 'newAuthor';
console.log(novel.writer);
/*The console would display the strings anonymous and newAuthor.

Notice the syntax used to invoke the getter and setter. 
They do not even look like functions. Getters and setters are important because they
 hide internal implementation details.

Note: It is convention to precede the name of a private variable with an underscore (_). 
However, the practice itself does not make a variable private.*/
