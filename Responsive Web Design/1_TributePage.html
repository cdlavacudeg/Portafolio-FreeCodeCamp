          <ul id="list-dates">
            <li> 1998: Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."</li>
            <li> 1999: Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming (XP), and the usage of user stories in the planning game.</li>
            <li> 2001: Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:
              <ul>
             <li>The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts;</li>
             <li>The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;</li>
             <li>The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.</li></ul>
            <li>2001: The XP team at Connextra[6] in London devised the user story format and shared examples with others.</li>
            <li>2004: Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development that is now considered the standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories.[citation needed] While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the invention.</li>    
            <li>2014: After a first article in 2005 and a blog post in 2008, in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give better visibility to their interdependence.</li>
